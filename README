About this project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements the Server Client model using user datagram protocol (UDP) and allows Servers and Clients
to exchange messages between each other. The class ServerSetup saves(serializes) the InetAddress (IP) of the server in a text 
file and then Clients extract(deserializes) the InetAddress from this text file to learn where to send their packets. 
This allows the Server and Clients to be run on multiple computers (instead of locally on one computer).

Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clone my ServerClient repository.
Run ServerSetup on the computer that will act as the server. This will save the IP address in the address.txt file.
Push the changes made to address.txt to your cloned repo. 
On the Client computer import the files from the repo. 
Now the initial setup is complete
Run ServerSetup again on the Server computer
Run Client on the Client computer.
Send messages back and forth using the console :).
